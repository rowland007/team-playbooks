Using this simple framework, reflect back on your work and use what you've learned to improve as a team. Prep Time: 5 mins Run Time: 60 mins People: 2 - 8 What You'll Need Remote Video Conferencing with Screen Sharing Digital Collaboration Tool (see templates) Timer In-Person Meeting Space Whiteboard Markers Sticky Notes Optional Templates Confluence Template Trello Template Miro Template Retrium Template Instructions for Running this Play Tip: Large Groups Have more than 8 people? Set aside 90 minutes for groups of 8-12, and at least 2 hours for more than 12 people. Prep 5 MIN For remote teams, start by creating a collaboration document, such as a Trello board or Confluence page. You can use the templates provided, if you\u2019d like, or create one of your own. For in-person teams, find a whiteboard or large paper and set out sticky notes and markers in a meeting room. Create six columns labeled Milestones, LOVED, LOATHED, LONGED FOR, LEARNED, and Actions. Before the session, agree as a team on the time period you\u2019d like to look back on. Tip: Last Quarter If your company runs on a quarterly schedule, looking back on the last quarter is a good place to start. Set the Stage 5 MIN Let your team know the following at the start of the meeting: The reason we\u2019re taking the time to talk about how we have worked is to see how we can make improvements. We\u2019re coming into this meeting understanding that everyone did the best that they could given their knowledge and tools. This meeting is a safe space. Nothing that is shared will be used against anyone. We\u2019re here to explore, not to blame. Key Moments 5 MIN Have the team think back over the chosen time period. What were the key events that occured? Provide a few examples, such as goals met, team celebrations, team members joining, company events. Anchoring the team in key milestones jogs the team\u2019s memory of events that occurred and how they felt about them. Then set a timer for 5 minutes for people to add their own key events to the Milestone column. Reflect 10 MIN Tip: Give it Time Giving time to write allows for processing and reflection while also giving quieter team members space for sharing their ideas. Explain the four lists to the team: \"LOVED,\" \"LONGED FOR,\" \"LOATHED\" and \"LEARNED.\u201d LOVED: what you loved about your work over the time period. This is what you want to keep doing, or do more of, in the future. Example: ROI See how one team captures ROI for their \u201cLoved\u201d responses. LONGED FOR: what you wish you\u2019d had. It could be more people, more time, more coffee. Nothing is off the table. LOATHED: what made life worse back then. What do you hope will never happen again? LEARNED: what you learned from your successes and your mistakes. Set a timer for 10 minutes for everyone to add their own thoughts to each list. Decide What to Do 15 MIN Tip: Focus The fewer actions you have to take, the more likely it is you\u2019ll get them done. Start with just one action item for each list. Give everyone 10 minutes, as a team or in breakout groups, to discuss: One action you\u2019ll take to remove something from your LOATHED list. One action you\u2019ll take to amplify something from your LOVED list. Use your LONGED FOR and LEARNED lists to help shape your ideas for what actions to take. Share Your Action Plan 15 MIN Give each person or group a few minutes to share their plan. Use the actions list to capture each action. Make sure to include who will do it, what they are doing, and by when. Wrap Up 10 MIN Commit to when you\u2019ll track progress on actions on a regular basis, such as at team meetings or at the next 4Ls. Follow-Up Schedule Your Next 4Ls Play Once a quarter is a good start. Once you get the hang of it, try every two weeks, once a month, or after the end of a project cycle or sprint. Revisit Regularly Make sure to revisit your 4Ls with the team and check in on the progress of your actions. At the next 4Ls, you can talk about how those actions went. Variations Quantify In breakout groups, discuss the benefits of fixing items in your LOATHED list and continuing the things in your LOVED list, assigning each item a Return on Investment (ROI) based on effort and value. Use these values to decide which items to take action on. Example: ROI See how one team captures ROI for their \u201cLoved\u201d responses.","title":"4 Ls Retrospective"},{"location":"4lsretro/#what-youll-need","text":"","title":"What You'll Need"},{"location":"4lsretro/#remote","text":"Video Conferencing with Screen Sharing Digital Collaboration Tool (see templates) Timer","title":"Remote"},{"location":"4lsretro/#in-person","text":"Meeting Space Whiteboard Markers Sticky Notes","title":"In-Person"},{"location":"4lsretro/#optional-templates","text":"Confluence Template Trello Template Miro Template Retrium Template","title":"Optional Templates"},{"location":"4lsretro/#instructions-for-running-this-play","text":"Tip: Large Groups Have more than 8 people?

USE THIS PLAY TO... Make quarterly and annual plans that result in the highest impact, given the resources available. If you're struggling with shared understanding or value metrics on your Health Monitor , running this play might help. AND I NEED THIS... WHY? You and your team are at the end of a long and tumultuous planning cycle. You've assessed the relative impact of all the work you could take on, made some tough choices, and emerged with a prioritized set of projects you will take on. You're exhausted, but filled with purpose and hope nonetheless. Then it happens. A request comes in from another team. They've just been through the same process, and it turns out, they'll need a contribution from you to achieve their goals. But your own projects already max out your capacity! You want to be a team player, but... how? If you've ever struggled to prioritized requests from other teams against your existing work, or struggled to get another team to commit to work that your project relies on, this play is for you! WHO SHOULD BE INVOLVED? All relevant project and/or team leads. Individual contributors and exec sponsors can sit this one out. Prep Time: 30 mins Run Time: 60 mins People: 3 - 6 What You'll Need Remote Video Conferencing with Screen Sharing Digital Collaboration Tool (see templates) Timer In-Person Meeting Space Whiteboard Markers Sticky Notes Index Cards Instructions for Running this Play Some things simply won't get done. And that's ok, as long as you agree to tackle the mission-critical stuff first and work outward from there. Prep Prior to the session, fill out an index card for every piece of work you're prioritizing. The units of work can be on any scale (tasks, user stories, projects, initiatives, etc.), but it's a lot easier if everything is on a similar scale so you're comparing apples to apples. Each card should describe the four factors you'll take into consideration: Description Expected Outcome Level of Effort Risks and Dependencies Example Follow this pattern for each of your index cards. Name of Project Description What is this and why is it being considered? Risk & Dependencies Who else needs to be involved? What could stop the project from being successful? Level of Effort Story points or t-shirt sizes work well here. Be realistic! Expected Outcome How will this add value for customers and/or the business? Set the Stage 5 MIN Get the group into the right mindset: even though there are multiple teams involved here, we are one company with a common purpose. If we prioritize with this in mind, we stand a fighting chance of coming to a shared understanding of what will (and won't) help us achieve our mission. If we don't, we risk competing against each other and delaying the things that matter most. Set Up the Matrix 5 MIN Draw a 2x2 grid on a whiteboard or butcher's paper and write your teams top goals above it. Label the X-axis \"Urgency\", with \"Sooner\" on the far-left side and \"Later\" on the far-right side. Label the Y-axis \"Impact\", with \"Low\" at the bottom and \"High\" at the top. Above the matrix, write your team's most important goal. (Or maybe top 2 goals.) Tip Articulating your team's North Star will be much easier if you're green on \"shared understanding\" in your Health Monitor . Otherwise, try running the OKRs , Goals Signals and Measures , or Elevator Pitch plays before prioritizing. Prioritize Your Own Team's Work 20 MIN As a group, stick the cards on the board, positioning them relative to the other cards based on their impact on your goals and how soon they need to be done. Discuss the positioning as a group and keep moving the cards until you've got an even distribution across the board. It's natural to start with everything at the top left but spreading them out is crucial. Draw Feasibility Lines 10 MIN Draw 2 arcs across the board to separate the must-haves from the nice-to-haves and those you probably won't do. Anything in the top-left is protected because it simply must be done. Nothing should be in here if it's not vital to achieving the goal. Anything in the bottom right is likely to be pushed out. This doesn't mean it won't ever get done, just not until the more important work is complete. Try to limit the \"must-haves\" to about 40% of your team's capacity, and the \"nice-to-haves\" to about 30%. This leaves you with some capacity to accommodate the requests you've gotten from other teams \u2013 not to mention the hot ones that might will get thrown into your path. Tip Agreeing on what you're prepared to delay or simply not do can lead to some uncomfortable moments. Keeping the group laser-focused on your North Star helps take the edge off. Incorporate the Asks 15 MIN As you prioritize other teams' requests against what's already on your plate, ask yourselves these questions: Are the other team's goals mission-critical? (Like, at a company level?) If you didn't accommodate the other team's request, what impact would that have on their goal? Once you've positioned the ask(s), redraw your lines to reflect what you can now achieve. If accommodating the ask means you're putting your own goal at risk, call it out and discuss options. If both teams' goals are mission-critical, talk to leadership about getting additional people. If the other team's goal is mission-critical and yours is not, just do it. (doit) If neither teams' goal is mission-critical, you'll need to look at the subtleties and reach an agreement. Tip Whatever the result from this exercise, make sure you communicate the decisions you've made, any resulting risks to achieving your goals and the reasons why. Example Check out a priority matrix created by the Confluence Server team. Follow-Up Communicate the results of this session to your full project team, stakeholders, and anyone else whose work may be affected. Highlight your reasons for drawing the lines where you did, as well as any risks that remain.","title":"Prioritize Allthethings"},{"location":"allthethings/#what-youll-need","text":"","title":"What You'll Need"},{"location":"allthethings/#remote","text":"Video Conferencing with Screen Sharing Digital Collaboration Tool (see templates) Timer","title":"Remote"},{"location":"allthethings/#in-person","text":"Meeting Space Whiteboard Markers Sticky Notes Index Cards","title":"In-Person"},{"location":"allthethings/#instructions-for-running-this-play","text":"Some things simply won't get done.
