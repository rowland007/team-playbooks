# Overview

A repository template copies all of its settings and content over to newly created repositories in that project. Utilizing this feature allows users to manage settings centrally & ensure that your repositories are always correctly configured. There is no need to define certain settings all over again. It includes branches and file (README, LICENSE, .gitignore, and .github/workflows) in the template repository every new repository will automatically have. The feature will mirror the content from the template to the new repositories.

# Configuration

## Settings

After you've cloned the *new* repo, go into `Settings` and on the left handside, look for `Pages`. Make your settings look like the following:

### Source

`Deploy from a branch`

### Branch

`gh-pages`  :file_folder:`/(root)`

## Files

This repository includes the following files

- [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
- [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md)
- [License](LICENSE.md)
- [Readme](README.md)

- [Github Workflow](.github/workflows/ci.yml)
    - This workflow watches the master branch and every time a commit is made, it uses the [mkdocs.yml](mkdocs.yml) file and the `docs/` folder to build mkdocs static website and deploy the repos documentation to the `gh-pages` branch automatically. The documentation can then be viewd at `https://<username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`. For example, this repo's documentation is located at [https://rowland007.github.io/template-repository/](https://rowland007.github.io/template-repository/).

## Branches

This repository initializes two branches, `master` and `develop`.
