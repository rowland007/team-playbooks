# Disclaimer

These playbooks are a copy & paste from [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook/plays). In their [FAQ](https://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook/plays#) it states, "Play instructions and content are free. Use them as much as you want and feel free to share these resources with others." I do not take credit for these plays and state that they are Copyright Â© 2022 Atlassian. I am saving these to this repo as an archive should Atlassian decide to remove the Plays.
