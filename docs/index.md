!!! abstract "Executive Overview"
    This repository serves two purposes. One is to provide a structure and shell files to create further repositories without having to copy files or look for information. The second is to provide documentation on how to write and maintain documentation for those repos.

    Well-written documentation can make all the difference for a piece of software in terms of adoption, utilization, and maintainability. Most of the time it is dreaded and an afterthought due to time constraints. When possible, we should use the code is documentation principle. However, documentation may cover other aspects that are not highlighted in the code. For example build instructions, required dependacies, and enviromental variables. Additionaly, by providing guidance on how to write code and documentation, it keeps all developers on the same page and shared mental model.
